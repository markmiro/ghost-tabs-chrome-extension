<!-- ## Some tab icons don't change when they should -->

<!-- ## Disabling the extension doesn't reset the favicons back to normal -->

<!-- Note: this is also addressed in the after-install.html page -->
## Extension stopped working after I disabled and re-enabled it

The extension loads scripts into each page so it can update the favicon. However, this script largely runs autonomously and can't be notified about the exact moment an extension is uninstalled.
